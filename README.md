### Technologies.

JAVA
> <div align="justify">Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in the early 1990s. It is a platform-independent language that allows the creation of cross-platform applications that can run on various operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. </div>

MAVEN
> <div align="justify">Maven is a build automation tool primarily used in Java projects. It is similar to the Ant tool, but it is based on different concepts and works in a different way. It is also used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala and other languages. The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation, which was part of the former Jakarta Project. </div>

### Patterns and architectures.

REST
> <div align="justify">(Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services. It is based on a client-server model, where the client makes requests to the server, which then responds with the requested information. RESTful web services are built using the principles of REST, and use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to retrieve or manipulate data. RESTful web services are lightweight, easy to implement, and can be easily consumed by a wide range of clients, including web browsers, mobile apps, and other servers.</div>

RESTfull
> <div align="justify">(Refers to a web service that adheres to the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer). A RESTful web service is designed to be lightweight, easy to implement, and easy to consume. It uses standard HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to retrieve or manipulate data, and uses a simple, standard format (such as JSON or XML) to represent the data. RESTful web services are often preferred over other types of web services because they are easy to understand and use, and are supported by a wide range of clients and servers.</div>

VO design pattern
> <div align="justify">(The Value Object (VO) design pattern is a type of software design pattern that is used to represent a value object. A value object is an object that represents an entity with immutable data, such as a date or a currency. These objects are used to represent application data and are typically passed as parameters between layers or between objects. In general, value objects do not have behavior, they are just data containers. They are comparable to each other and comparable to other value objects based on their value.</div>
